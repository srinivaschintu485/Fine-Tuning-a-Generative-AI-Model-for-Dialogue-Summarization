# Fine-Tuning-a-Generative-AI-Model-for-Dialogue-Summarization
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a generative AI model for dialogue summarization using the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face. The project explores both full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to enhance the model's performance and efficiency.
