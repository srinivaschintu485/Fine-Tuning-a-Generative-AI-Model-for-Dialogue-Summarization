# Fine-Tuning-a-Generative-AI-Model-for-Dialogue-Summarization
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on fine-tuning a generative AI model for dialogue summarization using the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face. We explore both full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, evaluating the results using qualitative assessments and ROUGE metrics.
